Hi, I’m @P3DROO

I'm new to the github scene and just starting out, i've been working in IT for about 5 years, i'm currently working on the Helpdsk, 
although i'm looking to develop my skills and find the path that is right for me.

I’m interested in a number of different sports mainly Football (UK Version), all things Tech, Music and Movies.
I’m currently learning how to use GitHub, Linux and a number of different certs that I have mapped out.
I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet, but that may change in the future.
